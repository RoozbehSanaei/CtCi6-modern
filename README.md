This repository contains solutions to the problems in "Cracking the Coding Interview" (6th edition) implemented using modern features in Python and C++. While the primary focus of the main book is on algorithmic comprehension, it is crucial for programmers to be familiar with modern language features, as they are extensively employed in real-world software development

C++ and Python languages offer an extensive array of modern features that equip developers with a diverse set of tools and techniques for addressing intricate problems and implementing novel solutions which their benefits is inclusive but not limited to the following:

**Readability**: Modern language features can make code more readable, making it easier to understand and modify, thus improving its maintainability.

**Expressiveness**: Modern language features can make code more expressive, allowing developers to write code that is more concise and more straightforward to reason about.

**Better memory management**: Modern language features often provide more efficient memory management techniques, such as garbage collection or automatic memory allocation.

**More robust error handling**: Modern languages often come with more advanced error handling capabilities, allowing developers to catch and handle errors more effectively.

**Efficiency**: Modern language features can help improve code performance, making applications more efficient and cost-effective.

**Scalability**: Modern language features can help make code more scalable, allowing software systems to handle an increased workload without compromising performance.

**Evolvability**: Modern language features offer developers new ways of approaching problems and writing code, making it possible to write software that is more flexible and adaptable to changing requirements.
